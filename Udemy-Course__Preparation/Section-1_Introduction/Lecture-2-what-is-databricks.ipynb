    "  * On the other hand, a **storage account** is deployed in the **data plane** in your own subscription. It is used for *Databricks File System* or *DBFS*. In addition, when you want to set up a **spark cluster**, the cluster virtual machine will be also deployed in the data plan. So to summarize, the compute and the storage will be always in your own cloud account.\n",
