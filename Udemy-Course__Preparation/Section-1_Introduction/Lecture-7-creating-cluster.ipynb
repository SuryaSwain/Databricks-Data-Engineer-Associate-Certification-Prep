    "## What to Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *cluster* is a set of nodes or computers working together like a single entity. \n",
    "  - It consists of a master node called the *driver* and some other *worker* nodes. \n",
    "  The driver node is responsible for coordinating the workers and their parallel execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Your cluster could be multi node, that is having multiple workers, or simply a single node. \n",
    "  A single node cluster, has no workers and run Spark jobs on the driver node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Databricks Runtime* is the virtual machine's image that comes with preinstalled libraries, \n",
    "which has a specific version of Spark, Scala and other libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Photon* is a vectorized query engine developed in C++ to enhance Spark performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *DBU* stands for Databricks Unit and it is a unit of a processing capability per hour.\n",
