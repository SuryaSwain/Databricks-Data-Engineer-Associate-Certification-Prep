    "\n",
    "A ***data stream*** is any data source that grows over time.\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "  - a new data in a data stream might correspond to a new JSON log file landing into a cloud storage, \n",
    "  - updates to a database captured in a CDC or Change Data Capture feed\n",
    "  - events queued in a pub/sub messaging feed like Kafka.\n",

    "### Processing Data Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "To process a data stream, usually you have two approaches: \n",
    "  - either a traditional approach where you reprocess the entire dataset each time you receive a new update to your data.\n",
    "  - Or another approach would be to write a custom logic to only capture those files or records that have been added since the last time an update was run.\n",
    "    And here we can use the spark structured streaming to achieve this goal."

    "\n",
    "Simply by treating it as a table.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Input Streaming Table\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said, an input data stream could be a directory of files, a messaging system like Kafka, or simply a Delta table.\n",

    "Delta Lake is well integrated with spark structured streaming.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can simply use `spark.readStream()` to query the delta table as a stream source, which allows to process all of the data present in the table as well as any new data that arrive later.\n",

    "streamDF = spark.readStream\n",
    "                .table(\"Input_Table\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a streaming data frame on which we can apply any transformation as if it were just a static data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to persist the result of a streaming query, we need to write them out to durable storage using `dataframe.writeStream` method.\n",
    "With the `writeStream` method, we can configure our output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "streamDF.writeStream\n",

    "        .table(\"Output_Table\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here for example, we trigger the streaming processing every 2 minutes to check if there are new arriving records, and we choose to append them to the target table.\n",
    "\n",
    "So again, after another 2 minutes, we will check if there are new arriving data and we append them to the target table.\n",
    "\n",

    "By default, if you don't provide any trigger interval, the data will be processed every half second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can specify a fixed interval as we did previously.\n",
    "So the data will be processed in micro batches at your specified interval, for example, every 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can run your stream in a batch mode to process all available data at once using either trigger `once` option, or `availableNow` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the trigger will stop on its own once finished processing the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference is that with the trigger Once, all available data will be processed in a single batch, compared to multiple micro batches in availableNow option."

    "## Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured streaming provides two guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fault Tolerance\n",
    "   \n",
    "    First in case of failure, the streaming agent can resume from where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thanks to both the checkpointing and also a mechanism called *Write-ahead logs*, they allow to record the offset range of data being processed during each trigger interval, to track your stream progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exactly-once guarantee\n",
    "\n",
    "    Structured streaming also ensures exactly once data processing because the streaming sinks are designed to be idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    That is, multiple writes of the same data, of course identified by the offset, do not result in duplicates being written to the sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, the two guarantees here only work if the streaming source is repeatable, like cloud based object storage or pub/sub messaging service.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, taking all together, repeatable data sources and idempotent sinks allows spark structured streaming \n",
    "to ensure end-to-end exactly-once semantics under any failure condition."

    "Yes, it is true that most operations on a streaming data frame are identical to a static data frame, but there are some exceptions to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations such as **sorting** and **deduplication**, are either too complex or logically not possible to do when working with streaming data.\n",
