    "  *CTAS statements* or *Create Table As Select statements* create and populate data tables using the output of a SELECT statement.\n",

    "- Here is an example. We are creating table number 1 and fill this table by data retrieved from table number 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **[CTAS: Filtering and Renaming Columns]** \n",
    "    In this example, the statement creates a new table, `table_1` containing a subset of columns from `table_2`. And we are also renaming the column 3.\n",
    "\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **[CTAS: Additional Options]** \n",
    "    In addition, the `CREATE TABLE` clause contains several options.\n",
    "    You can provide a descriptive comment for the table. This allows for easier discovery of table contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```SQL\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE new_table\n",
    "    COMMENT \"Contains PII\"\n",

    "    Here we are adding a comment indicating that the table contains Personal Identifiable Information like the name and the email of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The underlying data of a data table can be partitioned in subfolders by the value of one or more columns.\n",
    "    Here we are partitioning by the city and birthdate.\n",
    "    Partitioning can improve the performance of huge delta tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, small to medium sized tables will not benefit from partitioning, because partitioning physically separates data files which results in a small files problem.\n",
    "    This can prevent file compaction and efficient data skipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As a best practice, you should default to non partition tables for most use cases when working with Delta tables.\n",
