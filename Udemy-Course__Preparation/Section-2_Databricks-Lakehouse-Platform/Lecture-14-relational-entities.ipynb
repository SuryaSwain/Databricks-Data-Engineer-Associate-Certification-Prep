    "### Table types\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Databricks, there are two types of tables: managed tables and external tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"../../assets/images/Presentation-Images/Databricks 2 types of tables.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" >\n",
    "  </div>   \n",
    "\n",
    "  * *A managed table* is when the table is created in the storage \n",
    "    under the database directory, which is the default case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, an *external table* is when the table is created in the storage outside the database directory in a path specified by the `LOCATION` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For a managed table, Hive owns both the metadata and table data, \n",
    "    which means that it manages the lifecycle of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So when you drop a managed table, the underlying data files will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, for external tables, Hive owns only the table metadata, but not the underlying data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So when you drop an external table, the underlying data files will not be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External table\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We can simply create an external table in the default database simply \n",
    "    by using the `CREATE TABLE` statement with the `LOCATION` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"../../assets/images/Presentation-Images/create an external table in the default database.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" >\n",
    "    </div> \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The definition for this external table will be in the hive metastore under the default database.\n",
    "    While the data files will be stored in the specified external location.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In the same way, we can create an external table in any database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"../../assets/images/Presentation-Images/create an external table in any database.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" >\n",
    "    </div> \n",
    "\n",
    "    Simply, we specify the database name with the keyword `USE`,\n",
    "    and we create the table with the `LOCATION` keyword, \n",
    "    followed by the path to where this external table needs to be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We could choose the same path as the one for the default database \n",
    "    or simply use another location like in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    And again, the table definition will be in the hive metastore \n",
    "    while the data files will be in the specified external location.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Even if the database was created in a custom location outside of the hive default directory, \n",
    "    we can normally create an external table in this database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "    Here, for example, we choose the same path as the one of the previous example.\n",
