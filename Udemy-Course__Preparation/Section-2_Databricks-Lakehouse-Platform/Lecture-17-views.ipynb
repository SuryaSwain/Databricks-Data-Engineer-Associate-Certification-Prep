    "In this video, we will talk about the views in databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll understand what is a view in Databricks and how to work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will explain the different types of views.\n",
    "\n",
    "A view in Databricks is a virtual table that has no physical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it is just a saved SQL query against actual tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this query is executed each time a view is queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of views in Databricks: the classical view, also known as stored view, Temporary\n",
    "\n",
    "views.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Global Temporary views.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover now each one of them, and explain it in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like tables, stored\n",
    "\n",
    "views are persisted in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a view.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Create View statement with the AS keyword followed by your SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created,\n",
    "\n",
    "you can query your view with a standard SELECT statement, just as if it were a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary view is tied to Spark session, so it is dropped when the session ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a temporary review, we simply add TEMP or TEMPORARY keyword to the Create view command.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the question is when a Spark session is created in Databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there are several scenarios in which a new Spark session is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when opening a new notebook, a new session is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also when detaching and reattaching a notebook to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "And after installing a Python package, which leads to restarting the python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or simply after restarting the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type of views is a Global Temporary view.\n",
    "\n",
    "it behaves much like other views, but differs in one important way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tied to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the cluster is running, any notebook attached to the cluster can access its global temporary\n",
    "\n",
    "views.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a global temporary view, we simply add GLOBAL TEMP to the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global temporary views are added to a cluster's temporary database called global_temp.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you query this view in a SELECT statement, you need to use the global_temp database qualifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, let us do this comparison between views, temporary views, and global temporary views.\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored views are like tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their definition is stored in the database, but again, not the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a view is nothing but a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the views are stored in the database, they can be accessed across multiple sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary views, on the other hand, are only accessible in the current session.\n",
    "\n",
    "While global temporary views can be accessed across multiple sessions but within the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To drop a stored view,\n",
    "\n",
    "you should use the DROP VIEW command, while Temp views are dropped automatically when the session ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global temporary views automatically dropped as well\n",
    "\n",
    "but when the cluster restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, there is a small difference in the CREATE VIEW statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We add TEMP keywords for creating temporary views, while we add the GLOBAL TEMP keyword for creating\n",
    "\n",
    "global temporary views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for this video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now switch to Databricks to work with the views in notebooks."
