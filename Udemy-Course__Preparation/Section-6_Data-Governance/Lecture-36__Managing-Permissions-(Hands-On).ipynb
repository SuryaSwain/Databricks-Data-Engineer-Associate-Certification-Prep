    "In this demo, we will explore how to manage permissions for **databases**, **tables**, and **views** in **Databricks SQL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating to Databricks SQL Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the **Databricks SQL Workspace**.  \n",
    "Make sure that your **SQL warehouse** is running.  \n",
    "Now, navigate to the **SQL editor** in the left sidebar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Database and Table\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will create a database called `HR_DB`.  \n",
    "Within this database, we will create a table called `employees` with `ID`, `name`, `salary`, and `city` columns.  \n",
    "Then, we will insert some data into this table.  \n",
    "Lastly, we will create a view for `employees` in **Paris city**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us run these commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring Permissions for Other Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in order to allow other users to access this new database and table, let us configure their permissions.  \n",
    "We will create a new query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by granting several privileges on the whole `HR_DB` database to a group of users called **HR Team**.  \n",
    "So, all the members in this group will have the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read** and **modify** the data.\n",
    "- Access **metadata information**.\n",
    "- Create a new object like tables and views in this database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us run this command.  \n",
    "Great. Now, the **HR team** has the necessary privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for users to perform any action on a database object, they must have an additional privilege, which is the **USAGE** privilege.  \n",
    "Without this privilege, the objects in the database cannot be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can run a specific SQL command simply by selecting it and clicking **Run Selected**.  \n",
    "Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning Privileges to Individual Users\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also assign privileges to individual users.  \n",
    "Here, for example, we are granting **read access** on our view object to a user from outside of the **HR team**.  \n",
    "Let us select this query and click **Run Selected**.  \n",
    "Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing Assigned Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, let us review the assigned permissions using the `SHOW GRANTS` command.  \n",
    "Yes, indeed, the **HR team** has all the granted privileges.  \n",
    "And I am the **owner** of this database as I was the one who created it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also show the granted privileges on our view.  \n",
    "Here, we can see the user **Adam** indeed has the **SELECT** privilege on this view.  \n",
    "And the **HR team** inherited the database privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Data Explorer for Permissions Management\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the **SQL editor**, we can also use the **Data Explorer** to manage permissions.  \n",
    "From the left-side navigator, select the **Data** tab to access the **Data Explorer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Data Explorer** allows users and admins to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate different data objects like **databases**, **tables**, and **views**.\n",
    "- Explore data schema, metadata, and history.\n",
    "- Set and modify permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can find the database we created previously.  \n",
    "By clicking on the database name, it displays a list of the containing tables and views on the left-hand side.  \n",
    "On the right, you will see some details about the database, like the **owner information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **Permissions** tab to review who currently has permissions on this database.  \n",
    "As expected, we see here the granted privileges for the **HR team** group.  \n",
    "You can select a privilege here and click on **Revoke** to remove this privilege.  \n",
    "The privilege has been successfully revoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the Owner\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can also change the owner.  \n",
    "If you click here, you have the option to **edit the owner**.  \n",
    "An owner can be set as an individual or a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us set the owner to **admins**, which is the default group containing all workspace administrators.  \n",
    "As you can see, the **admin group** now is the owner of this database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Granting Permissions to Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, from this window, you can also grant permissions.  \n",
    "Let's say we would like to allow all users to review **metadata** about this database.  \n",
    "We click the **Grant** button.  \n",
    "We select **All Users** group.  \n",
    "And we choose both **READ_METADATA** and **USAGE** privileges.  \n",
    "Click on **Grant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we see here the granted privileges to the **Users** group.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Permissions for Tables and Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can manage permissions for tables and views.  \n",
    "Simply, we click on the table name.  \n",
    "Then, you click on the **Permissions** tab.  \n",
    "From here, let us, for example, give all users the ability to query this table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We click first on the **Grant** button.  \n",
    "We select the **All Users** group.  \n",
    "And we choose the **SELECT** privilege.  \n",
    "Lastly, we click **Grant**.  \n",
    "Now, all users can query this table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Explorer Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the **Data Explorer** is a really useful and powerful tool to manage your data objects.  \n",
    "However, at present, only the **ANY FILE** object cannot be set from the **Data Explorer**.  \n",
    "You need to use the **SQL editor** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query History\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s interesting about **Databricks SQL** is that you can see all the SQL queries run behind the **Data Explorer**.  \n",
    "Simply, navigate to the **Query History** in the left sidebar.  \n",
    "As you can see, **query history** shows all the queries run in the **Databricks SQL**, including the **Data Explorer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Great.  \n",
    "That’s all about **Databricks SQL**.  \n",
    "See you in the next video."
