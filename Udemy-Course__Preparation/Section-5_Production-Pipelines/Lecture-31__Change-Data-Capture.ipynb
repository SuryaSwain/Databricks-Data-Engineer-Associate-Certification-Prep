    "\n",
    "- It automatically orders late-arriving records using the user-provided sequencing key. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - This pattern ensures that if any records arrive out of order, downstream results can be properly re-computed to reflect the updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It also ensures that when records are deleted from a source table, these values are no longer reflected in tables later in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The default behavior for insert and update operations is to upsert the CDC events into the target table. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  That means it updates any rows in the target table that match the specified key, or inserts new records when a matching record does not exist in the target table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optional handling for delete events can be specified with the `APPLY AS DELETE WHEN` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can specify one or many fields as the primary key for a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Except` keyword can be added to specify columns to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly, you can choose whether to store records as **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)**, **Type 1** or **Type 2**. \n",
    "\n",
    "  `Apply Changes Into` defaults to creating a **Type 1** slowly changing dimension table, meaning that each unique key will have at most one record, and that the updates would overwrite the original information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since data is being updated and deleted in the target table, this breaks the append-only requirements for streaming table sources. That means we will no longer be able to use this updated table as a streaming source later in the next layer.\n",
