    "- **Apply As Delete When**: Here, you specify that records where the operation field is \"Delete\" should be deleted.\n",
    "- **Sequence By**: Specifies the sequence field for ordering how operations should be applied.\n",

    "### Features of the `Apply Changes Into` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "- It automatically orders late-arriving records using the user-provided sequencing key. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - This pattern ensures that if any records arrive out of order, downstream results can be properly re-computed to reflect the updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It also ensures that when records are deleted from a source table, these values are no longer reflected in tables later in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The default behavior for insert and update operations is to upsert the CDC events into the target table. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  That means it updates any rows in the target table that match the specified key, or inserts new records when a matching record does not exist in the target table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optional handling for delete events can be specified with the `APPLY AS DELETE WHEN` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can specify one or many fields as the primary key for a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Except` keyword can be added to specify columns to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly, you can choose whether to store records as **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)**, **Type 1** or **Type 2**. \n",
    "\n",
    "  `Apply Changes Into` defaults to creating a **Type 1** slowly changing dimension table, meaning that each unique key will have at most one record, and that the updates would overwrite the original information.\n",

    "### Disadvantage of the `Apply Changes Into` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `Apply Changes Into` has one disadvantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since data is being updated and deleted in the target table, this breaks the append-only requirements for streaming table sources. That means we will no longer be able to use this updated table as a streaming source later in the next layer.\n",
